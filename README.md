# About this project 
Description: 
            Healthcare and Machine learning is a Predictor ML project, which works on various machine learning algorithms. The main work of these algorithms is to handle a large amount of data, and then make the core model for any Machine Learning model. The main purpose of any predictor model is to give us the predictions for the required TARGET base on the collection of data. The raw data is sliced and split into two parts, mainly training and testing data sets. The idea behind this is to train the model and finally when it is complete, then feed the model new Features and get the predictions for those data. And thatâ€™s how the whole project works.
